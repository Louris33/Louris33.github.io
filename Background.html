									<h3>My Career Shifter Story</h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic08.jpg" alt="" /></span>When I came to the point of having felt the need to shift career from the call center industry, I remembered my subjects during college about C++ and started to download tutorials online. From thereon I keep on learning about computer programming and on how to effectively absorb knowledge on every article and series that I watch. Honestly, it was a headache especially in the beginning.</p>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic09.jpg" alt="" /></span>Despite the headache of learning a little about computer programming and its development, I feel a lot better whenever I learn new things and find solutions. Being able to realize the outcome of practice, I felt the passion and drive to learn more and keep on going. The computer programming makes practice make me more rational than just emotional in life aspects. I knew then that this is what I want to pursue up until the day I retire.</p>
